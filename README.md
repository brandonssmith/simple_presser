Simple key presser for bluestacks

This is a simple key presser I made for bluestacks.  Specfically I made this for Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes.  In the game it is easy to accumulate ally points but difficult to spend them so I created this app to press one key over and over again.

USAGE
1) Install bluestacks
2) Assign a key (any alpha numeric key) to the lower right button.
3) Run the script.
4) Tell it what key you want it to press (the same key as in step 2).
5) Tell it how many times to press the key -  I was getting about 100k ally points done in 10,000 presses.
6) Alt-Tab over back to bluestacks
7) wait

DEPENDENCIES
- pyautogui
install is simply pip install pyautogui

That's it.  You're on your own.  You use it then you assume responsibility for it.
